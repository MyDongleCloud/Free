# Why this project?

* Get back your sovereignty!
* Fight enshittification and crapification!
* It's time to de-Google and un-Microsoft!

If you disagree 👎, fine with us 😅, but this project is probably not for you.


# Dedicated hardware
**MyDongle.Cloud** has been optimized to run on a dedicated ARM-based dongle sold by [https://mydongle.cloud](https://mydongle.cloud).

[**Click here to download the 🄵🅁🄴🄴   🅅🄴🅁🅂🄸🄾🄽**](https://mydongle.cloud/download).

It's a lot of work; it would be appreciated that you give a ⭐ to this project if you download it.


# Easy installation of the free version

Installation consists of:
1. [Downloading the free version](https://mydongle.cloud/download) (7 GB).
2. Giving a ⭐ to the project. 😅
3. Burning the downloaded .img file to a micro SD card or a NVME disk.
4. Booting your Raspberry Pi5.
5. Visiting [https://app.mydongle.cloud/setup](https://app.mydongle.cloud/setup) to set up your **MyDongle.Cloud**.

Connection will be done via Bluetooth LE from your browser to the PI5 during the setup. The Raspberry Pi5 will then be associated to your home Wi-Fi.


# Your cloud URLs

During Setup, you will be asked for your cloud name. We recommend you provide your full name. This will translate into your main **MyDongle.Cloud** URL. It will be your main website:

* **`https://johndoe.mydongle.cloud`**

We also provide a "shortcut" URL. We recommend you provide your initials. It will be your alias:

* **`https://jd.myd.cd`**

If you own a domain name, you can host it via **MyDongle.Cloud**. It will be another alias:

* **`https://example.com`** = **`https://johndoe.mydongle.cloud`**

<small>*If you host your own domain name, its DNS should point to our DNS server ns1.mydongle.cloud.*</small>

Then, the **main web app** to control your cloud will be available at:

* **`https://app.johndoe.mydongle.cloud`**

Each **module** will be available also as a sub-domain. For instance:
* **`https://mail.johndoe.mydongle.cloud`** (or **`https://mail.example.com`**)
* **`https://chatbot.johndoe.mydongle.cloud`**
* **`https://officesuite.johndoe.mydongle.cloud`**
* ...

Your mail address will be:

* **`whatever@johndoe.mydongle.cloud`** (or **`whatever@example.com`**)

## FAQs
**Q.** Do you store any information on your server?

**A.** All data is stored on either the dongle if you buy one, or on your Raspberry Pi5 for the free version. We don't want to see your data. That's the whole point of this project! We only store on our server your cloud name, your email address (to fight any abuse, no marketing spam!) and the IP address of the dongle (or the Raspberry Pi5) for the right DNS entries.

**Q.** Can I run completely independently from **MyDongle.Cloud**?

**A.** Yes. You need your own domain name example.com and point some DNS records (read the [docs](https://docs.mydongle.cloud)) to the external IP address of the dongle (or the Raspberry Pi5).
